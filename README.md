# Elbridge

Elbridge is a TUI Gerrymandering game.

## Installation

### Linux / Unix / MacOS (I think)

`git clone` this repo. Upstream / main / master is `git clone https://github.com/will-koz/elbridge`

There are no additional requirements for installation (requirements.txt is just for Microsoft
Windows).

### Microsoft Windows

<!-- TODO -->

## Running

On *nix, run `./main.py` and on Microsoft Windows, run `py main.py` in the directory you cloned to.
